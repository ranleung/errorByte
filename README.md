Learn to Code by Learning Coding Errors in a trivia format!

## Overview

As a student of life, I am constantly learning and improving. Personally, what I found to be the greatest lessons are those when I encounter drawbacks. While coding, these drawbacks translate directly into errors. 

I believe that everyone should try and encounter as much errors as possible. I hope this app will empower beginner coders as much as I did while creating those errors. 

Catch all the errors!

## Motivation

I remember vividly the days where I have spent countless hours on errors that I could have solved in less than a minute.  Only if I have understood the error the first time and know where to look to fix it, I would have been far more efficient coder.

But I am glad I spent those countless hours on a specific error, because now I know how to react and solve those errors in less than a minute.

I hope you will feel the same with these practice problems from errorByte.
